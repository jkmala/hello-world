# hello-world
my first git - helloworld

## Something about me
This is my first try of Github. Our teacher recommended this to all students as if we use it correctly, it will save our time when reporting homeworks. And by the way I am a student at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Science, Helsinki Finland. Degree is called bachelor of information technology.
